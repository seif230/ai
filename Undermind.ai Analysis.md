# Undermind.ai Analysis

Undermind.ai is a web application designed to assist researchers with literature review and scientific discovery. Key features observed include:

## Core Functionality:

*   **Generate Insights:** Brainstorm with an AI expert that has read relevant literature and generate custom tables to support research.
*   **Verify Responses:** Trace any statement by following in-line citations back to the source paper.
*   **Gauge Relevance:** Quickly assess if a paper is relevant to a specific question and sort/filter results.
*   **Stay Up to Date:** Receive notifications when relevant papers are published.

## User Interface/Experience:

*   The landing page highlights the ability to "Condense weeks of research to minutes" and acts as an "AI assistant that carefully explores the scientific literature."
*   It features a prominent search bar with example queries.
*   Testimonials from researchers are displayed, emphasizing the tool's effectiveness and time-saving capabilities.
*   The platform is built by researchers (quantum physics PhDs from MIT) with experience in deep research.

## Underlying Mechanisms (Inferred):

*   Reads thousands of papers.
*   Carefully evaluates paper relevance.
*   Adapts search strategy recursively.
*   Traverses the full citation graph.

## Databases (Inferred from user prompt):

*   PubMed
*   ArXiv
*   Google Scholar

This analysis will serve as a foundation for designing our own web application, focusing on replicating and enhancing these core functionalities.
