# Research Assistant - AI-Powered Academic Search Platform

## Overview

I have successfully created a comprehensive web application similar to Undermind.ai that provides AI-powered academic search capabilities. The application integrates with PubMed and ArXiv databases, uses LLM for query refinement and follow-up questions, and generates detailed research reports with inline citations.

## Key Features

### 1. **Multi-Database Search**
- **PubMed Integration**: Direct access to biomedical literature via NCBI E-utilities API
- **ArXiv Integration**: Access to preprints and research papers via ArXiv API
- **Unified Results**: Normalized display of results from different sources

### 2. **AI-Powered Query Refinement**
- **Follow-up Questions**: LLM generates intelligent questions to clarify research intent
- **Query Suggestions**: Provides refined query alternatives for better search results
- **Context-Aware**: Uses search results context to improve suggestions

### 3. **Interactive User Interface**
- **Modern Design**: Clean, professional interface with responsive design
- **Paper Selection**: Checkbox-based selection system for report generation
- **Real-time Feedback**: Loading states and progress indicators
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between different data sources

### 4. **Research Report Generation**
- **Comprehensive Reports**: AI-generated reports with multiple sections
- **Inline Citations**: Proper academic citation format with clickable references
- **Structured Content**: Executive summary, literature review, findings, and conclusions
- **Export Ready**: Formatted for academic use

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (Flask)
- **Framework**: Python Flask with CORS support
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/api/search` - Multi-database search functionality
  - `/api/refine_query` - LLM-powered query refinement
  - `/api/generate_report` - Research report generation
- **Database Integration**: Direct API calls to PubMed and ArXiv
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo for natural language processing

### Frontend (React)
- **Framework**: React with modern hooks and state management
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library with Tailwind CSS
- **Features**: 
  - Dynamic search interface
  - Paper selection and management
  - Report display and formatting
  - Responsive design for all devices

### Data Sources
- **PubMed**: NCBI E-utilities API for biomedical literature
- **ArXiv**: ArXiv API for preprints and research papers
- **Future**: Architecture supports easy addition of Google Scholar and other sources

## Application Workflow

1. **Search Phase**:
   - User enters research query
   - System searches PubMed and ArXiv simultaneously
   - Results are normalized and displayed with source indicators

2. **Refinement Phase**:
   - LLM analyzes the query and search context
   - Generates follow-up questions for clarification
   - Provides refined query suggestions

3. **Selection Phase**:
   - User selects relevant papers using checkboxes
   - Visual feedback shows selected papers
   - Generate Report button becomes active

4. **Report Generation**:
   - LLM processes selected papers
   - Generates comprehensive research report
   - Includes proper citations and references
   - Displays formatted report with inline citations

## Deployment Information

- **Live Application**: https://5000-ivcg5kp39qf3150xwtto7-8a410218.manusvm.computer
- **Status**: Fully functional and tested
- **Performance**: Optimized for fast search and report generation
